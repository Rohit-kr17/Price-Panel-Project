# Price-Panel-Project
This is an HTML file with embedded CSS stylesheets. The file contains a pricing panel that compares the features and prices of three different smartphones: iPhone 14 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, and OnePlus 11 Pro.

The HTML structure includes a head and a body. The head section contains meta tags for character set and viewport, a title, a link to an external CSS file, and internal styles. The body section contains a div with a class "panel" that encloses the pricing plan of each smartphone.

The CSS styles define the appearance of the pricing panel, including font size, color, weight, and family, background color, border radius, padding, width, margin, and text alignment. The styles also define the layout of the pricing plan, including flex direction, border, spacing, and alignment. The styles define the size and margin of the images, the font size and weight of the headers and features, the border and background color of the buttons, and the transition and hover effects of the buttons. The styles also define media queries for responsive design for screens larger than 900px.

The pricing plan of each smartphone includes an image, a header, a subheader, a list of features, a price, and a button. The features of each smartphone are listed in the form of bullet points, highlighting the most important specifications. The prices are displayed in bold font and are followed by the currency symbol. The buttons are styled as links with a border and a background color that changes on hover.
